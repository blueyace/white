I hope the world is kinder to you this year and hope that you can achieve all that you dream of and more. Thank you for existing alongside me :) you make me and so many others' lives gentle and warm. All of your friends appreciate your kindness and comforting presence in their lives, I hope you know how needed and appreciated you are. Compliments are hard, no? But these aren't mere words of affirmation or comfort, these are collective, accumulated shared emotions. Even the little boy who earned a 1o rupee note from selling you a little packet of incense sticks will remember you and your willingness to help. Kindness is often taken for granted but in reality, it's pretty rare. People always expect something in return when offering their help, but the same can't be applied for you. I'm priviledged to have been given the chance to meet you, I mean it! You inspire those around you to become better versions of themselves, that's your superpower. You don't pry but your company and actions do more at comforting than words ever could. You make trusting someone so easy, you create that safe space for people to fall back into whenever. Your friends, teachers, everyone else who's ever had and will have the chance of coming across someone like you, will harbour nothing but positive feelings and a warm place in their memories for you! I know it's hard to stomach a feeling so large, a burden of negativity that you've been forced to carry for all these years and that it can't be brushed off that easily, that it's hard to believe that you're worth so much and that you deserve great things when all you've habituated yourself to is quite the exact opposite. But it's okay, I'll remind you of it from time to time! I don't mind it a bit! I know it isn't easy but i genuinely hope that you find kindness for yourself somewhere along the way and learn to see yourself in a better light. You're also human, you're also suffering, mostly silently at that.

Sometimes close your eyes and just imagine the little you. I know we all have our own regrets, things we'd redo in a blink, but stop there for a moment, 
<br>
look past all of that, 
<br>
do you see the little guy standing amidst a battlefield unprepared? 
<br>
When we grow up, we all learn of how our wounded childhood is cause we were left to fend for ourselves before we barely even learnt to stabilize ourselves on our own two feet. So when you close your eyes and think of little shubhro, instead of hurting or reprimanding him, maybe be his parent/guide so that he won't feel lost or not understood. Give him all the things you know he'd be desperately searching for so that he doesn't ever have to return empty handed. Tell him he's worth it quite often so that growing up he knows that he's worthy of love and deserving of being loved. 
<br><br>
Shubhro, breathe yeah? You're doing so so well, I'm so proud of how far you've come and that too all on your own accord. As long as you live, your personality will always attract others to wholeheartedly cheer you on, on your endeavors. You deserve all of this, don't you dare undermine yourself you hypocrite. And of course all of this is to say I love you and I'm glad to have your love with me as well <3 (I'll keep it safe)
<br><br>
Take caree!! Grow healthier and live a long and fulfilling life!
